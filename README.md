My passion for cybersecurity drives me to engage in hands-on projects that address complex challenges across areas such as vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response. These initiatives provide opportunities to work directly with security tools and frameworks, enabling deep exploration of emerging threats and mitigation strategies. I encourage you to review these projects to see how I've applied technical solutions to enhance security operations and improve organizational resilience.
## üñ•Ô∏è Intro to Cyber Security & Asus PC Build
In this video, I build a custom PC that I‚Äôll be using as part of my journey into the cybersecurity field. While the video focuses on the build process, this machine will support my learning, labs, and future projects as I work toward breaking into the industry.

## üî¨Home Lab
I created a cybersecurity home lab environment to simulate real-world scenarios using virtual machines. This setup allows me to explore email analysis, phishing detection techniques, network traffic analysis with Wireshark and TCPdump, and evaluate security tools such as intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and endpoint detection solutions.

## üõ°Ô∏è  Josh Makador's Cyber Range
In March 2025, I joined Josh Makador‚Äôs Cyber Range as an intern to gain hands-on experience in a real-world lab environment. During this internship, I‚Äôve actively worked on vulnerability management, threat hunting exercises, and leveraged Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Defender to strengthen cloud-based security practices.
