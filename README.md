Hi, I'm Ebonee,  a proud 🔵 teamer!

I'm passionate about securing company infrastructure and exploring roles such as SOC Analyst, Security Analyst, Vulnerability Management Analyst, Compliance Analyst, and Security Awareness Specialist. My goal is to help protect people and organizations from the growing threats that impact their work, privacy, and everyday lives.

I believe in continuous learning, improvement, and knowledge sharing to help strengthen organizations against evolving cybersecurity challenges.

Feel free to explore my projects to see how I apply my skills in real-world scenarios as I grow in this field.



## 🖥️ Intro to Cyber Security & Asus PC Build
In this video, I build a custom PC that I’ll be using as part of my journey into the cybersecurity field. While the video focuses on the build process, this machine will support my learning, labs, and future projects as I work toward breaking into the industry.

## 🛡️  Josh Makador's Cyber Range **(Hands on experience with Microsoft Azure, Defender, Sentinel & Tenable Nessus)**
In March 2025, I joined Josh Makador’s Cyber Range as an intern to gain hands-on experience in a real-world lab environment. During this internship, I’ve actively worked on vulnerability management, threat hunting exercises, and leveraged Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Defender to strengthen cloud-based security practices.

## 🔬Home Lab
I created a cybersecurity home lab environment to simulate real-world scenarios using virtual machines. This setup allows me to explore email analysis, phishing detection techniques, network traffic analysis with Wireshark and TCPdump, and evaluate security tools such as intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and endpoint detection solutions.
