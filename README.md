My passion for cybersecurity drives me to engage in hands-on projects that address complex challenges across areas such as vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response. These initiatives provide opportunities to work directly with security tools and frameworks, enabling deep exploration of emerging threats and mitigation strategies. I encourage you to review these projects to see how I've applied technical solutions to enhance security operations and improve organizational resilience.
